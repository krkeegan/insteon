# Insteon Hub
A tool for managing Insteon device links using the Insteon Hub.

# The Problem
The Insteon Hub can manage device attributes such as default on levels and ramp rates.  It can also control devices, such as turning them on. It can also create links between the Hub and the devices including "scene" links using one of the Hub's 255 groups.

But it cannot help you in creating links between devices in your network.  Insteon apparently expects you to still do this manually. 

# The Goal
Create a simple interface for defining, scanning, and managing the links between the devices on your network.

# Status
A long way from being done.  I have taken much of the code from other half-completed (or less) projects that I have started.
